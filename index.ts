/**
 * pi-delegate — extension entry point.
 *
 * Installs the transport once and registers the delegate tool layer on it.
 * Also mounts the ambient fleet UI on session_start —
 * guarded by ctx.hasUI so headless runs stay inert. Command wiring
 * (/delegate-fleet, /delegate-teardown) lives in src/observe.ts
 * (registerCommands, moved there in W6) — index only calls it.
 *
 * Install (local-only repo, symlinked into pi's auto-discovery dir):
 *   ln -s /root/projects/pi-delegate ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-delegate
 *
 * Architecture and the dependency rule (no src/ module imports the transport
 * implementation — the transport is injected here): ARCHITECTURE.md Law 4.

 *     pairing holds on every session replacement.
 *   - the WATCHER mounts are additionally arbitrated per session file inside
 *     observe.ts (globalThis registry): a second mount for an already-mounted
 *     session file is refused there — this covers a double module load, where
 *     two copies of THIS module each register handlers (each copy's shutdown
 *     tears down its own context's handles; the refused second watcher mount
 *     returns the first instance's handle, so both copies converge on the
 *     same idempotent stop).
 *   - RESIDUAL (deliberate, documented in observe.ts's header): two separate
