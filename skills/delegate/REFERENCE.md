The contract: you are the orchestrator. You decompose, brief, spawn, collect, verify, merge. Execution lives in worker sessions — separate pi processes in herdr panes, each with a fresh context. Tier routing: the decision tier (frontier-class) briefs, reviews, and synthesizes; the execution tier (flash-class) implements, fixes, enumerates, verifies. Prompt the execution tier tight and structured — it is a small model.

## 1. Pre-flight

Gate: `test "${HERDR_ENV:-}" = 1`. If it fails, report that delegation over herdr is unavailable and stop.

Clock check: `journalctl --no-pager --since '-5 min' | grep -c 'Clock change'`. Recurring steps mean the host clock is being reset (competing NTP/hypervisor sync) — herdr waits and input handling become unreliable (raw escape flushes into panes, broken pipes). Report it to the user before launching long `--wait` orchestration.

1. Choose the transport per worker:
   - **Interactive worker** (herdr pane, session kept) — the default; supports follow-up prompts, questions, and mid-run re-briefs.
   - **Headless one-shot** (`pi -p`) — a single artifact from a throwaway probe. Add `--approve` (headless modes skip the trust prompt) and narrow tools (`--tools read,bash`).
2. Assign tier and budget per worker: execution work ≤ ~150k tokens; repeats ≤ 2 per issue; iterations ≤ 5 for write/review loops.
3. Create the exchange dir: `mkdir -p /tmp/exchange/{TASK}` (`{TASK}` = short slug).
4. For a fan-out of ≥3 workers, run a smoke test first: one probe worker prompted to reply exactly `OUTPUT: OK` (catches dead panes, wrong flags, overloaded tiers). A probe's reply is the final verdict — a probe never writes a report file.

Completion: every planned worker has a name, tier, budget, and brief path. Names match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}`, unique among live agents.

## 2. Brief

One brief file per worker in the exchange dir (`brief-<name>.md`). The prompt sent to the pane is one line pointing at it — long prompts wrap and mangle in narrow panes.

- **ROLE** — one line: tier, read/write scope ("You are facts-worker F1, read-only").
- **TASK** — bounded, single outcome. Verbatim artifacts (exact fix shape, exact text) for risky changes; equivalence argument for rewrites.
- **CONTEXT** — file pointers only: spec path, prior reports, worktree path, branch, base commit. Paste nothing the worker can read.
- **CONSTRAINTS** — the owned surface first ("You edit exactly these files"), then the danger surface as explicit negatives (no git-write commands, no builds, no docker, no tool X).
- **OUTPUT** — exact report path + format, ending: "Before replying, verify the report file is written. Reply with only the file path." Shape the report after the canonical example (`REPORT_EXAMPLE` in `src/transport/types.ts`) — never copy report JSON from a stale brief (§19.6 drift).
- **BUDGET** — tokens / time slots / iterations.

Completion: brief exists on disk; the planned prompt is a single `Read <path> …` line.

## 3. Spawn

Default topology: **one worker = one worktree workspace**. `herdr worktree create` returns a full isolated workspace in one call — the worker's own tab (panes never crowd yours), its own git branch, and a root shell pane already cd'd into the checkout at `~/.herdr/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`. It needs a git repo: target your workspace (`$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`) or pass `--cwd <repo-path>`; `--base <REF>` picks a non-HEAD base.

```bash
# one worktree workspace per worker
WT=$(herdr worktree create --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID" \
       --branch "task-research-1" --label "research-1" --no-focus)
WS=$(echo "$WT" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["workspace"]["workspace_id"])')
P=$(echo "$WT"  | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["root_pane"]["pane_id"])')

# start the worker in the worktree's root pane (flags after --)
herdr agent start research-1 --kind pi --pane "$P" --timeout 90000 -- \
  --provider llm-platform --model "tensorzero::function_name::flash" --thinking high

# send the brief and wait for the run to settle
herdr agent prompt research-1 "Read /tmp/exchange/{TASK}/brief-research-1.md and follow its instructions exactly. Reply with only the file path." --wait --timeout 1800000
```

**Worktree authority:** only the root orchestrator creates and removes worktrees. A sub-orchestrator — an orchestrator itself running inside a worktree workspace (your brief says so, or `pwd` is under `~/.herdr/worktrees/`) — must never call `worktree create`/`worktree remove`. It spawns its workers as new tabs in its own workspace: one tab per worker, all sharing the same checkout and branch.

```bash
# sub-orchestrator spawn: tab in my worktree workspace, not a new worktree
T=$(herdr tab create --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID" --label "worker-a" --no-focus)
P=$(echo "$T" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["root_pane"]["pane_id"])')

herdr agent start worker-a --kind pi --pane "$P" --timeout 120000 -- \
  --provider llm-platform --model "tensorzero::function_name::flash"
```

The tab's root pane inherits the worktree cwd. Workers sharing one checkout are a file-slice fan-out: give each a disjoint file list in its brief.

Names auto-uniquify on collision (`facts-1` → `facts-2`): read the name back from the `agent start` response and prompt that name, not the one you requested.

Fall back to sibling pane splits only when a worker needs no git isolation (read-only fact workers, non-repo tasks). Split from your own pane, `--no-focus`, same cwd; alternate right/down so no pane gets sliver geometry.

```bash
: > /tmp/exchange/{TASK}/panes.txt   # truncate; stale lines become bogus pane targets
for i in 1 2 3; do
  herdr pane split --current --direction down --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus \
    | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["pane"]["pane_id"])' >> /tmp/exchange/{TASK}/panes.txt
done
i=0
while read -r p; do
  i=$((i+1))
  herdr agent start w$i --kind pi --pane "$p" --timeout 120000 -- \
    --provider llm-platform --model "tensorzero::function_name::flash" > /tmp/exchange/{TASK}/w$i.start.json 2>&1 &
done < /tmp/exchange/{TASK}/panes.txt
wait   # all starts resolved before prompting
```

Startup `--timeout` 60–180 s; prompt `--wait` timeout = expected task length (10–30 min for execution work).

Completion: `herdr agent get <name>` shows the worker working (or blocked) for every spawn, and every worktree worker's workspace id + branch is recorded for teardown.

## 4. Collect

The report file is the result. `herdr agent read` is for status and short answers only — rows that leave the alternate screen never reach scrollback, so long worker output read from the terminal is silently truncated.

1. For each worker, read the agreed report file with the `read` tool. `ENOENT` = the worker produced nothing: treat as a failed spawn, not an empty result.
2. Poll instead of blocking when running other work: `herdr agent list`, or `herdr agent get <name>` per worker; status vocabulary `idle | working | blocked | done | unknown`. `done` means the turn ended — the report file is the completion criterion, not the status.
3. `blocked` = an approval or question UI. Read the pane, answer the question (or `send-keys <name> esc` to decline and re-brief).
4. Cross-check conflicting worker reports by spawning one tie-breaker verifier with both reports as CONTEXT, or resolve it yourself from source.

Completion: every worker has a report file on disk, read by you.

## 5. Verify and re-delegate

You are the single merge gate: workers commit in their own worktree/scope; they never merge, never push, never open PRs.

- Verify against the brief's OUTPUT: acceptance criteria as PASS/FAIL with file:line evidence.
- Worktree workers spawned by the root commit on their own branch in their own checkout — their diff is `git diff <base>` inside the worktree.
- Sub-orchestrator workers share the sub-orchestrator's checkout and branch: disjoint file lists per brief, one build runner at a time.
- A failed worker's result is input, not waste: **replace the failed prompt with a diagnosed retry** — a new brief that names the wrong path taken, the root cause, and the required fix shape. A verbatim retry is a banned move; the diagnosed retry is the move. ≤2 repeats per issue, then escalate to the user.
- Repair prompts get tighter, never looser.

Completion: DoD verified (tests/acceptance criteria), all changes accounted for, merge order decided by you.

## 6. Teardown and audit

1. Worktree authority is root-only here too: a sub-orchestrator inside a worktree closes its own tabs — `herdr tab close <tab_id>` per worker tab — and never removes the worktree. The root removes worktree workers: `herdr worktree remove --workspace <ws_id> --force` per worker — deletes the checkout and closes its workspace, tab, and agent in one call; no separate `pane close`/`workspace close` needed. Pane-split workers: `herdr pane close <pane_id>` per pane. Names release implicitly.
2. One mutating herdr command per tool call, and log the planned sequence to `/tmp/exchange/{TASK}/teardown.log` first — a mutating op can hang up your pane's process group, killing every step queued after it in the same call.
3. A tool call that returns no output during herdr state changes is not evidence of failure — the op may have completed server-side. Reconcile from `herdr workspace list` / `agent list` and `~/.config/herdr/herdr-server.log` (every API request is logged with its outcome), then close leftovers idempotently.
4. If `worktree remove` answers `not_linked_worktree`, the workspace is an orphan from a server crash mid-removal (observed on 0.8.2): recover with `workspace close <ws_id>`.
5. For a run of ≥3 workers, close with an audit from the session store: workers spawned, wall time per worker, tokens per tier, repeats — parse `usage` blocks in `~/.pi/agent/sessions/…/<session>.jsonl`, not estimates.

## Reference — supervision

- Stuck interactive worker: `herdr agent send-keys <name> ctrl+c`, then re-brief. Headless liveness: `nohup … &` + `ps -p $!` check, `pgrep -af "pi .*-p"`.
- Mid-run correction to a working worker: send a short steering prompt (state + instruction), e.g. "STEP 0 resolved upstream — do not cherry-pick, continue with STEP 1".
- A resumed session can sit inside a worker pane: `herdr agent start … -- --session <path-to.jsonl>`.
- Tier overload: re-delegate to a different tier (e.g. flash → chat/beta) rather than queuing behind an overloaded one.

## Reference — topologies

| Topology | Shape | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Ticket fan-out | one ticket = one worktree = one branch = one agent | independent implementation tickets — realized by the default spawn in §3 |
| File-slice fan-out | N agents, one worktree, disjoint file lists per agent | mass mechanical edits (javadoc, renames) |
| Axis fan-out | one reviewer per review axis → synthesize under your recommendation | code review, audits |
| Hypothesis fan-out | ≥3 independent workers on orthogonal hypotheses; hold the superposition until evidence collapses it | diagnosis, ToT investigations |
| Role chain | investigator → planner → developer → verifier → narrator over one artifact | feature delivery with human-facing report |
| Two-tier swarm | root → per-repo/tech-lead orchestrators → workers | multi-repo epics (cap depth at 3; workers that delegate are the exception, not the rule). Root owns all worktree create/remove; sub-orchestrators spawn tabs inside their own worktree |

## Reference — anti-patterns

- Brief pasted into the prompt → put it in a file; the prompt points at it.
- Long result read from the pane → read the report file.
- `done` trusted as completion → the report file exists is the criterion.
- Failed prompt retried verbatim → diagnosed retry with root cause + fix shape.
- Workers merging or pushing → orchestrator is the merge gate; workers commit in scope only.
- Manual `rm` of herdr-managed state (`~/.herdr/`, a repo with open worktree workspaces) → herdr commands are the only lifecycle API; delete a repo only after its worktree workspaces are closed.
- Parallel builds in one worktree → one build runner at a time; file-disjoint scopes.
- Interactive tools with rich TUI inside worker panes → workers answer questions in files; you poll and answer.
- Unbounded fan-out → smoke test first, cap concurrency, budget per tier.
- Briefs that omit the exchange dir or report path → the loop has no collection point; always OUTPUT first.
