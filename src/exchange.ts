/**
 * pi-delegate — src/exchange.ts (W3 refactor: merged module).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the exchange dir: report/schema/mailbox-file lifecycle
 * + the durable report archive.
 *
 * Purpose: /tmp/exchange/<task>/ conventions — brief/manifest/report path
 * rules, the manifest read/update protocol, strict report validation (v1
 * base schema + brief-declared reportSchema fragments incl. $extends
 * resolution), the mailbox file lifecycle (q-/a- envelopes, §23 release
 * marker) and progress-ping reads — plus the report archive under
 * ~/.pi/agent/delegate-archive (§19.3).
 *
 * Dependencies: @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent (parseFrontmatter,
 * withFileMutationQueue), typebox/value entry (deep specifiers are BLOCKED
 * by typebox 1.3.7's exports map — see the note in the import block),
 * node builtins, and ./host.ts (types + envelope guards ONLY — never
 * the herdr implementation). Also owns the shared exchange-dir conventions
 * as single-source constants (probe dir suffix, teardown audit trail name
 * + line format) — migration stage 1.
 *
 * Exported surface (union of the two merged sources, verbatim, plus the F1
 * fleet-accounting section, plus the migration-stage-2 manifest storage
 * port):
 *   - manifest/fs: ensureExchangeDir, ExchangeDir, ExchangeManifest,
 *     ManifestWorker, readManifest, updateManifest, scanAllManifests,
 *     reportPathFor
 *   - manifest storage port (migration stage 2, audit step 5): ManifestStore
 *     (read/update/append/scan), createFileManifestStore,
 *     createMemoryManifestStore, manifestStore (the process default, file-
 *     backed). ALL manifest consumers (spawn, observe, fleet, index, the
 *     fake host adapter) go through the port — the raw functions remain
 *     exported as the file implementation's building blocks and for tests.
 *
 * Manifest format (migration stage 2, audit step 6): ManifestWorker gained
 * the ONE optional extension field `embodiment` (run ordinal + placementRef
 * — the embodiment identity; semantics live in src/lifecycle.ts, the single
 * lifecycle owner). Legacy entries without it are read by the backward
 * adapter; external consumers of the manifest are unchanged.
 *   - F1 fleet accounting: TaskUsageSnapshot, describeFleet,
 *     applyFleetTaskFields, aggregateTaskUsage
 *   - reports/schemas: validateReport, validateReportAgainstSchema,
 *     parseBriefSchema, resolveReportSchema, resolveReportSchemaInDir,
 *     loadLibrarySchema
 *   - mailbox: questionPathFor, answerPathFor, releasePathFor,
 *     ReleaseEnvelope, readQuestion, writeAnswer, writeRelease,
 *     progressPathFor, readLastProgress
 *   - archive: ARCHIVE_DIR, ARCHIVE_TTL_MS, archiveRoot, archiveReport,
 *     pruneArchive, listArchivedTasks
 *
 * Critical invariants OWNED here (report-ref-map.json hiddenInvariants):
 *   - append-before-start (manifest side): worker entries are appended by
 *     the spawn flow THROUGH updateManifest (after place(), before
 *     startAgent()); on a refused start the caller rolls back exactly the
 *     entry its own call appended (name + this paneId + no sessionPath) —
 *     updateManifest's withFileMutationQueue serialization is what makes
 *     that claim/rollback protocol safe against parallel spawns.
 *   - collectedAt-dedup (write side): only COLLECT stamps collectedAt, on
 *     successful report delivery; the watcher is a reader, never a writer
 *     (its `seen` dedup lives only in session memory — the stamp is what
 *     keeps a fresh session's watcher from re-waking on old reports).
 *   - answer-consumed-mtime: no worker-side ack exists — an answer counts
 *     as consumed iff the worker's report mtime POSTDATES the a-<name>.json
 *     answer file written by writeAnswer.
 *   - mailbox path conventions: q-/a-/release-/p- files live NEXT TO THE
 *     BRIEF in /tmp/exchange/<task>/, named by canonical worker name.
 *   - manifest writes are atomic (tmp+rename) and serialized via
 *     withFileMutationQueue on the target path.
 *   - F1 fleet-accounting set-once: `description` and `masterSessionPath`
 *     are written ONLY when absent (applyFleetTaskFields) — the first
 *     delegate call of a task fixes them, later spawns never overwrite.
 *   - F1 usage cache is a CACHE, not authority: the worker session JSONL
 *     files are the source of truth; aggregateTaskUsage recomputes from
 *     them on every read; only WRITERS (collect, via
 *     persistTaskUsageSnapshot) stamp the snapshot into the manifest —
 *     read paths (delegate_status) never write, so the read-only tool
 *     contract holds.
 *   - archive is best-effort by contract: any failure → null/0/[] — never
 *     throws past its callers.
 *
 * Error modes: ensureExchangeDir throws a typed E_BRIEF DelegateError;
 * every validator returns {ok:false, error} instead of throwing.
 *
 * Sections (banner-delimited, bodies byte-verbatim from the pre-merge
 * files; exchange's three ./transport/types.ts import blocks were hoisted
 * into the single top block below, retargeted at ./transport.ts):
 *   1. src/exchange.ts — conventions, manifest, reports, schemas, mailbox
 *      (versioned banner headers preserved verbatim).
 *   2. src/archive.ts — durable report archive + TTL prune (header
 *      preserved verbatim, incl. its namespace-style imports).
