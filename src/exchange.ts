/**
 * pi-delegate — src/exchange.ts (Wave 3a: exchange-root conventions module
 * + the transition facade).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the exchange dir conventions and the F1 fleet
 * accounting; facade for the extracted exchange-layer modules.
 *
 * Purpose: /tmp/exchange/<task>/ conventions — the exchange root rule
 * (exchangeRoot, incl. the $PI_DELEGATE_EXCHANGE_ROOT test override and the
 * win32 default), brief validation + dir opening (ensureExchangeDir,
 * ExchangeDir), the conventional report path (reportPathFor), the shared
 * dir/file classifiers (isProbeDir, teardownLogLine), the F1 fleet
 * accounting section (describeFleet, applyFleetTaskFields,
 * aggregateTaskUsage, persistTaskUsageSnapshot + TaskUsageSnapshot types)
 * and the progress-ping reads (progressPathFor, readLastProgress).
 *
 * Wave 3a decomposition (bodies byte-verbatim, one module per
 * responsibility; ARCHITECTURE.md Law 5):
 *   - src/archive.ts — the durable report archive + TTL prune
 *     (archiveRoot, archiveReport, ARCHIVE_TTL_MS, pruneArchive,
 *     listArchivedTasks).
 *   - src/manifest-store.ts — manifest types + read/update protocol + the
 *     ManifestStore port and its two implementations + scanAllManifests.
 *   - src/report-schema.ts — strict report validation + the brief-declared
 *     schema library ($extends resolution).
 *   - src/mailbox-store.ts — the q-/a-/release-/nudge-failed- envelope
 *     lifecycle (wire format FROZEN).
 *   - src/watch-store.ts — the watcher satellite persistence (retire-stamp
 *     layers + the durable delivered-facts store).
 *
 * TEMPORARY TRANSITION FACADE: every symbol moved by Wave 3a is re-exported
 * from here (see the facade block below the imports), so existing import
 * sites keep resolving unchanged. All src/ sites are already flipped to the
 * new modules; the facade remains for the test suite and any external
 * consumers and goes away one release after the flip (the plan's
 * no-big-bang rule). New code must import from the owning module.
 *
 * Dependencies: @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent (withFileMutationQueue via
 * updateManifest — through the manifest-store module), node builtins,
 * ./host.ts (types + guards ONLY — never the herdr implementation),
 * ./usage.ts (parseSessionUsage for the F1 roll-up), ./expaths.ts (the ONE
 * path builder), and the extracted modules.
 *
 * Manifest format (migration stage 2): ManifestWorker carries the ONE
 * optional extension field `embodiment` (run ordinal + placementRef — the
 * embodiment identity; semantics live in src/lifecycle.ts, the single
 * lifecycle owner). Legacy entries without it are read by the backward
 * adapter; external consumers of the manifest are unchanged.
 *
 * Critical invariants (report-ref-map.json hiddenInvariants; ownership with
 * the module that implements each):
 *   - append-before-start (manifest side, src/manifest-store.ts): worker
 *     entries are appended by the spawn flow THROUGH updateManifest (after
 *     place(), before startAgent()); on a refused start the caller rolls
 *     back exactly the entry its own call appended (name + this paneId + no
 *     sessionPath) — updateManifest's withFileMutationQueue serialization
 *     is what makes that claim/rollback protocol safe against parallel
 *     spawns.
 *   - collectedAt-dedup (write side): only COLLECT stamps collectedAt, on
 *     successful report delivery; the watcher is a reader, never a writer
 *     (its `seen` dedup lives only in session memory — the stamp is what
 *     keeps a fresh session's watcher from re-waking on old reports).
 *   - answer-consumed-mtime: no worker-side ack exists — an answer counts
 *     as consumed iff the worker's report mtime POSTDATES the a-<name>.json
 *     answer file written by writeAnswer (src/mailbox-store.ts).
 *   - mailbox path conventions: q-/a-/release-/p- files live NEXT TO THE
 *     BRIEF in /tmp/exchange/<task>/, named by canonical worker name
 *     (src/mailbox-store.ts; wire format frozen).
 *   - manifest writes are atomic (tmp+rename via the ONE shared
 *     atomicWriteFileSync in src/manifest-store.ts) and serialized via
 *     withFileMutationQueue on the target path.
 *   - F1 fleet-accounting set-once (OWNED here): `description` and
 *     `masterSessionPath` are written ONLY when absent
 *     (applyFleetTaskFields) — the first delegate call of a task fixes
 *     them, later spawns never overwrite.
 *   - F1 usage cache is a CACHE, not authority (OWNED here): the worker
 *     session JSONL files are the source of truth; aggregateTaskUsage
 *     recomputes from them on every read; only WRITERS (collect, via
 *     persistTaskUsageSnapshot) stamp the snapshot into the manifest —
 *     read paths (delegate_status) never write, so the read-only tool
 *     contract holds.
 *   - archive is best-effort by contract (src/archive.ts): any failure →
 *     null/0/[] — never throws past its callers.
 *
 * Error modes: ensureExchangeDir throws a typed E_BRIEF DelegateError;
 * every validator (src/report-schema.ts) returns {ok:false, error} instead
 * of throwing.
