/**
 * pi-delegate — fleet UI module: everything the extension renders about the
 * worker fleet (DESIGN.md §15 overlay, §19.4 ambient widget), plus the two
 * things the UI layers share: worker ownership classification and width-safe
 * text primitives.
 * <p>
 * MODULE_CONTRACT: fleet presentation layer — ownership classification,
 * wide-char-safe text helpers, ambient live-rows widget + tool-result
 * transcript rendering, and the /delegate-fleet full-screen overlay
 * (grouping / tree / fold / legend). W1 refactor: verbatim concatenation of
 * the old src/ownership.ts, src/ui/text.ts, src/ui/fleet-ui.ts and
 * src/ui/fleet.ts. W6: the worker-view aggregation (WorkerView +
 * buildWorkerView) moved in verbatim from observe.ts (ex src/state.ts) —
 * view-building (manifests × statuses → WorkerView) is view code and now
 * lives with the other view code; this broke the former runtime-benign
 * fleet<->observe import cycle (fleet imported buildWorkerView while
 * observe imported these render helpers). The graph is a DAG again:
 * observe → fleet is the only edge between the two.
 * Dependencies: exchange.ts (manifestStore), usage.ts (session JSONL
 * usage + the shared staleness constant), ./host.ts (the Transport seam +
 * gauge constants),
 * @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent TUI. The watch staleness constant
 * (WATCH_DEFAULT_STALE_AFTER_MS) is IMPORTED from usage.ts — the one layer
 * both this module and observe.ts already depend on, so the former
 * fleet<->observe cycle stays broken while the threshold is a single
 * value (FLEET_STALE_AFTER_MS is a transparent alias of it).
 * Exported surface: WorkerView, buildWorkerView | classifyOwnership,
 * OWNERSHIP_GLYPH, Ownership,
 * SelfIdentity, OwnershipPlacement | stripAnsi, visibleWidth, trunc,
 * clampLines, fmtK | FleetWidgetRow (widget row; historical name FleetRow is
 * kept alive by the ui/fleet-ui.ts facade, removed in W5 — importers use
 * FleetWidgetRow), FleetUIDeps, FleetFoldLine,
 * mountFleetUI, disposeFleetUI, renderLiveRows, foldLiveByOwnership,
 * notifyFleetIdle, renderDelegateLines | FleetRow (overlay row), FleetDeps,
 * FleetLayoutRow, FleetLayout, FLEET_FLOORS, fleetUsageOf, layoutFleetRows,
 * fitRow, GroupStatsRow, GroupClass, WorkerGroup, MEGA_GROUP_LIMIT,
 * FLEET_STALE_AFTER_MS, groupWorkerViews, rankGroups, groupHeaderText,
 * isFleetStale, fleetAgeText, groupFoldedText, megaFoldedText,
 * fleetFoldToggle, fleetFoldUnfolded, FleetRenderInput, packLegend,
 * renderFleet, openFleetOverlay.
 * Critical invariants (owned here, per report-ref-map.json hiddenInvariants):
 *   - line-width-clamping: EVERY TUI-rendered line must pass through
 *     clampLines / fitRow / trunc — an over-wide line crashes the whole TUI
 *     with uncaughtException (v1.8b field crash). All render fns here
 *     return clamped lines.
 *   - display fails CLOSED on ownership (deliberate asymmetry vs the
 *     watcher, which fails open): a marker is a claim, and an unknown
 *     worker must never render as "mine" (●) in either direction of
 *     missing data (classifyOwnership + ownershipGlyph).
 *   - fleet UI is ADVISORY: fs/transport read failures keep the last
 *     snapshot and never alter a spawn/collect/wake outcome.
 *   - the overlay is strictly read-only (fs reads + transport.listStatuses
 *     only; timers cleared on close AND dispose). The ambient widget's 2 s
 *     interval is NOT cleared when the live set goes empty (only on
 *     dispose) so the widget can re-mount on the next spawn.
 *   - FLEET_STALE_AFTER_MS shares the watcher's worker-stale default
 *     (§22): one stale threshold across watcher and fleet UI.
 * Error modes: none thrown to callers — all failures degrade (the E_*
 * taxonomy lives in transport.ts).

 * report/q/a existence checks, session JSONL usage parsing) and the
 * read-only transport.listStatuses() inside buildWorkerView(). No mutating
 * herdr calls, no mailbox writes, no timers left behind (interval is
 * cleared on close AND on dispose).
 *
 * STAGE 2 (fleet-UX wave 2): rows group by `manifest.dir ::
 * orchestratorSessionPath` (report-ux-tree.json). MINE rows render FLAT
 * exactly as stage 1 (zero single-session regression). FOREIGN/UNKNOWN
 * groups render an expanded dim header `▼ slug · live/total live · owner ·
 * ctx↑max%` with inline tree glyphs in the name column, and FOLD by default
 * to a self-describing line `~ <class> <slug> · N workers · counts… ·
 * idle <age>` (fleet-UX wave 4 retired the letter-flag alphabet `xN -- L B
 * ! Q v s` — counts are words, the stale `s` condition became an age tail
 * with an ownership-scoped remedy); Tab (0x09) toggles
 * (§4 exact: module-level session-scoped boolean, folded first-open
 * default, no-op when nothing foldable). Per-group sort replaces the
 * global status sort, with fully-stale groups demoted (wave 4); the height
 * window is group-atomic and stale-aware (fresh blocks trim first). All of
 * it is pure (groupWorkerViews/rankGroups/groupHeaderText/groupFoldedText/
 * megaFoldedText/renderFleet) and unit-tested headless in
 * test/fleet-tree-check.ts. The widget (fleet-ui.ts) is untouched.
