/**
 * pi-delegate — src/host.ts (WorkerHost seam, extracted from src/transport.ts).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the backend-neutral worker-host seam: Transport interface +
 * req/result types, the E_* error taxonomy (incl. DelegateErrorImpl/GUIDANCE),
 * the report/mailbox envelope contracts and their guards, the worker-name rule,
 * briefPrompt, the budget/context gauge constants, and sessionHasReply (the
 * aged-finish session-JSONL proof — backend-neutral, see research note in
 * design-host-interface.md §1a).
 *
 * Dependencies: node builtins only (fs). Depends on NO other src/ module —
 * bottom of the import graph (the old src/transport.ts SECTION 1 + the
 * backend-neutral sessionHasReply/Errors blocks, byte-verbatim).
 *
 * The herdr IMPLEMENTATION lives in src/herdr/host.ts (SECTION 2 verbatim);
 * it is bound ONCE in index.ts (workerhost migration steps 5–6 — the old
 * src/transport.ts re-export shim is deleted). Tool modules (spawn/observe/
 * fleet) import the seam from ./host.ts and must NEVER import
 * ./herdr/host.ts directly (pinned by static-check T1.1/T1.1c /
 * watcher-check W1.1).

/**
 * pi-delegate — transport seam and shared contracts.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: this file is authored by the tech lead and is the review artifact
 * for the whole extension. Implementation workers must NOT edit it; they code
 * against it. If a contract here is wrong, escalate to the orchestrator —
 * do not patch around it locally.
 *
 * Dependency rule: spawn.ts (tools) and index.ts (commands, absorbed in W5)
 * may import transport.ts and exchange.ts only. They must NEVER import the
 * herdr IMPLEMENTATION directly — createHerdrTransport is bound once in
 * index.ts (pinned by static-check T1.1/T1.1b).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT (ZCS, ported from the bundle's types.ts header): pure
 * types, constants and tiny pure helpers — no I/O of its own. Critical
 * invariants: DelegateErrorCode is the FIXED E_* list (the transport maps
 * every herdr failure into exactly one of them — never raw throws past the
 * tool boundary); WorkerReport is the schema BOTH the delegate tool
 * (validateReport) and the watcher validate reports against — changing it
 * breaks both sides at once; Transport implementations must serialize
 * mutating ops internally (DESIGN.md §9); REPORT_EXAMPLE is the canonical
 * report shape embedded into every worker prompt; CONTEXT_WINDOWS mirrors
 * pi's model catalog values and must be kept in sync with it manually.
