/**
 * pi-delegate — src/mailbox-store.ts (Wave 3a: extracted from src/exchange.ts).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the mailbox file lifecycle (q-/a-/release- envelopes
 * next to the brief, plus the retire-ack consume discipline).
 *
 * Purpose: the q-/a-/release-/nudge-failed- envelope files next to the
 * brief — path builders, tolerant readers (readQuestion/readQuestionState
 * with the read-with-reason result plane), atomic writers (writeAnswer,
 * writeRelease) and the envelope types (NudgeFailedEnvelope,
 * ReleaseEnvelope, QuestionRead).
 *
 * Since fix-report-heal (2026-09-12) this module ALSO owns the ONE
 * steer-posting core (postSteerAndNudge): envelope build + post + pane nudge
 * with retries + the nudge-failed marker machinery — shared verbatim by the
 * delegate_mailbox tool (mailbox-tool.ts) and the watcher's automatic
 * report-invalid fix nudge (watcher.ts). Law 9: no duplicated posting logic.
 *
 * Dependencies: @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent (withFileMutationQueue),
 * node builtins, ./host.ts (envelope types + guards + the Transport SEAM
 * type ONLY — never the herdr implementation), ./expaths.ts (the ONE path
 * builder), ./manifest-store.ts (the ONE atomic writer), ./tool-result.ts
 * (errText/sleep helpers).
 *
 * Critical invariants OWNED here:
 *   - mailbox path conventions: q-/a-/release-/nudge-failed- files live
 *     NEXT TO THE BRIEF in /tmp/exchange/<task>/, named by canonical worker
 *     name (wire format FROZEN — file names and envelope shapes are
 *     byte-identical to the pre-extraction module, with ONE additive
 *     exception since Wave 4 item 3 (Law 7): writers stamp an optional
 *     `schemaVersion: 1`; readers tolerate absent and reject wrong).
 *   - every write is atomic (tmp+rename via atomicWriteFileSync) and
 *     serialized via withFileMutationQueue on the target path; the ONE
 *     exception is the nudge-failed marker, whose best-effort plain write
 *     predates this module and whose tolerant reader makes a torn read
 *     degrade to "no marker" (documented at the write site).
 *
 * All bodies are byte-verbatim moves from src/exchange.ts (Wave 3a).
