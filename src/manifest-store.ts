/**
 * pi-delegate — src/manifest-store.ts (Wave 3a: extracted from src/exchange.ts).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — manifest types, the read/update protocol and the
 * manifest STORAGE PORT.
 *
 * Purpose: /tmp/exchange/<task>/manifest.json conventions — the manifest
 * types (ManifestWorker, ExchangeManifest, TaskUsageSnapshot), the tolerant
 * read (readManifest), the mutate-and-persist protocol (updateManifest,
 * serialized per path + atomic tmp+rename), the ManifestStore port (read/
 * update/append/scan) with its file-backed and in-memory implementations
 * and the process-default `manifestStore` singleton, plus the global
 * manifest scan (scanAllManifests + the foreign-backend filter).
 *
 * Dependencies: @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent (withFileMutationQueue),
 * node builtins, ./host.ts (Placement type ONLY — never the herdr
 * implementation), ./exchange.ts (exchangeRoot for the scan — a deliberate
 * module cycle: ESM live bindings resolve it, nothing reads the imported
 * binding at module-eval time) and ./archive.ts → the ONE atomic writer.
 *
 * Critical invariants OWNED here:
 *   - append-before-start (manifest side): worker entries are appended by
 *     the spawn flow THROUGH updateManifest; its withFileMutationQueue
 *     serialization is what makes the claim/rollback protocol safe against
 *     parallel spawns.
 *   - manifest writes are atomic (tmp+rename via the ONE shared
 *     atomicWriteFileSync, which now FSYNCS the tmp file before the rename —
 *     Wave 4 item 4, crash consistency: a crash after rename can no longer
 *     leave a renamed-but-never-flushed empty/short file) and serialized via
 *     withFileMutationQueue on the target path.
 *   - F1 usage cache is a CACHE, not authority (readers never write).
 *
 * All bodies are byte-verbatim moves from src/exchange.ts (Wave 3a).
