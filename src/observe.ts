/**
 * pi-delegate — observe FACADE (Wave 3 decomposition, steps 1–5 done): this
 * module no longer owns code — it re-exports the public surface of the
 * extracted observation modules so existing import sites keep resolving
 * unchanged for ONE release, per the decomposition plan (ARCHITECTURE.md
 * Law 5). After the release window the remaining import
 * sites (index.ts, compose.ts today; the check suite pins) flip to the new
 * modules directly and this file retires.
 * Re-audit note (2026-09-12): no production importer remains — index.ts and
 * compose.ts already import the extracted modules directly; only the check
 * suite pins still resolve through this facade. Retirement is scheduled for
 * the next cycle (README "Future work").
 *
 * Where everything lives now:
 *   - watch-config.ts  — the tolerant watch/collect config resolution
 *     (Wave 3a; kills the spawn→observe dependency edge, Law 6 pin).
 *   - watch-detect.ts  — the event model + snapshot building + detection
 *     (WatchEventKind/WatchEvent/DeliveryKey/eventKey, WatchWorker/
 *     WatchSnapshot, SelfIdentity, isWorkerSession, ownsChildManifests,
 *     workersFromManifests, readStatusesTolerant, collectSnapshot,
 *     DetectOptions, detectWorkerEvents, detectEvents).
 *   - watch-retire.ts  — the §23 retire engine (RetireReason/RetireDecision/
 *     RetireEval, mailboxDrained, evaluateRetire, stampWorkerViaSatellite,
 *     retirePass, RetirePassOptions).
 *   - watcher.ts       — the watcher loop + delivery + mount lifecycle
 *     (WatcherDeps/WatcherHandle, createWatcher, SendOutcome, makeSender,
 *     markDeliveredBeforeThrow, makeWatcherLogSink, formatEventBatch,
 *     formatWakeUpAuditLine, startWatcher, stopWatcher + the session-keyed
 *     mount registry on globalThis — Wave 2, Law 3).
 *   - status-tool.ts   — the `delegate_status` tool (registerStatusTool +
 *     formatFleetUsageLine and its read-only helpers).
 *   - commands.ts      — /delegate-fleet + /delegate-teardown
 *     (registerCommands).
 *
 * The invariants and contracts of every piece moved verbatim with the code —
 * each extracted module's header documents its own MODULE_CONTRACT. The
 * summary of the observation layer's guarantees (kept here because the
 * facade is the entry point existing docs still name): the watcher is
 * advisory by contract (a watcher failure must NEVER affect a spawn or a
 * collect); delivery is ownership fail-closed (the ONE canonical verdict in
 * watch-role.ts); dedup memory is a cache of the durable delivered-facts
 * store; mounts are keyed by session file in a globalThis registry (a second
 * mount for an already-mounted session is refused — audit D2); retire stamps
 * persist in the per-watcher satellite file, the manifest is never written
 * by the watcher; delegate_status is read-only by contract; /delegate-*
 * command names, tool names and parameter shapes are frozen surface.
 *
 * Law 6 (layering): no src/ module may import observe.ts except the
 * composition root's slices (pin T1.8 in test/static-check.ts). New code
 * imports the extracted modules directly.
