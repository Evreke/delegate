/**
 * pi-delegate — spawn module: everything the orchestrator DOES (DESIGN.md §5.1
 * `delegate` tool, §12 `delegate_mailbox` tool, §16–§18 schema/budget/prompt
 * pipeline, §19 settle/collect, §22 collect-time teardown, §23 release ACK).
 * <p>
 * MODULE_CONTRACT: orchestrator-side pipeline — worker-name validation, tier/
 * provider/model resolution, dual-gauge budget governor (E_CONTEXT/E_BUDGET),
 * brief reportSchema resolution, the spawn flow (place → manifest append →
 * startAgent → brief/probe prompt → waitSettle → grace rechecks → strict
 * collect + archive + collectedAt stamp + advisory auto-teardown), the
 * mailbox tool actions (read/answer/steer/release) and the LLM-facing
 * promptGuidelines contract text. Migration stage 2 (audit step 7): the
 * execute pipeline's settle→collect seam is an explicit state machine
 * (runGraceLoop/graceTransition — each transition takes the state and
 * returns the next) driven by the INJECTABLE clock/delay port (ClockPort,
 * systemClock, createVirtualClock) — the grace recheck loop is testable on
 * virtual clocks (test/grace-loop-check.ts); the execute closure keeps its
 * shape and delegates the seam to the machine. Migration stage 3 (audit step
 * 8): the settle completion criterion is the canonical report file observed
 * against THIS embodiment's witness (lifecycle.ts ReportWitness — content-
 * addressed, never file-mtime/wall-clock), and the settle outcome is the
 * seam's discriminated union (host.ts SettleResult "kind" variants) — the
 * backend status is an advisory sensor, never the criterion. W4 refactor:
 * verbatim concatenation of the
 * old src/tools/mailbox.ts (leaf, first) and src/tools/delegate.ts. The
 * ~1140-line execute() closure is kept AS-IS by design (user decision): its
 * closure-scoped mutables (sessionPath, manifestWarning, reportPath,
 * tierWarning, questionDetected, lastBeat, settleAbort) ARE the shared phase
 * state — no splitting into phase files, no ctx object; only zero-closure-
 * state pure helpers may ever be extracted.
 * Dependencies: ./host.ts (the Transport seam + E_* taxonomy + briefPrompt),
 * exchange.ts (manifest/report/mailbox lifecycle + archive), usage.ts
 * (session-JSONL gauges), observe.ts (watch/collect config resolution),
 * fleet.ts (render helpers + idle nudge). Never imports the transport
 * implementation (dependency rule, DESIGN.md §4.1 — the Transport instance is
 * injected from index.ts). Import graph: spawn is the root consumer —
 * transport/exchange/fleet/observe are all imported BY this module and none
 * of them import it (DAG holds, no module-eval cycles).
 * Exported surface: registerDelegateTool | registerMailboxTool (exact union
 * of the two source files' exports).
 * Critical invariants (owned here, per report-ref-map.json hiddenInvariants):
 *   - append-before-start (EXECUTION side; exchange.ts owns the file
 *     conventions via the manifest store): the ManifestWorker entry is appended
 *     after place() and BEFORE startAgent; a refused start rolls back ONLY
 *     the entry THIS call appended (match name + this paneId + no
 *     sessionPath) — never a pre-existing same-name worker.
 *   - answer-consumed-mtime (producer side): the mailbox tool writes
 *     a-<name>.json and archives the question file immediately after a
 *     successful answer (a stale q-<name>.json would re-fire
 *     AWAITING_ANSWER on a later same-name run); an answer counts as consumed
 *     iff the worker's report mtime postdates the answer file — consumer
 *     side: observe.ts mailboxDrained.
 *   - abort-detaches-never-kills (flow side): the abort signal cancels the
 *     WAIT, never the worker; from the moment the manifest entry exists,
 *     abort means DETACH — salvaging an already-valid report or probe
 *     verdict first. The wait-side contract lives in transport.waitSettle.
 *   - collectedAt-dedup (write side): after a VALID strict collect,
 *     collectedAt is stamped in the manifest — the watcher `seen` dedup is
 *     session memory only (observe.ts), so a fresh session would re-wake on
 *     old reports without the stamp. Migration stage 2: the stamp is a
 *     lifecycle REDUCER transition (lifecycle.stampCollected), scoped by
 *     embodiment placement ref — a same-name retry never re-stamps its
 *     predecessor's entry.
 *   - no-direct-herdr-for-reportless-verdicts (probe flow): probes NEVER
 *     write a report file — pane readback "OUTPUT: OK" is the final smoke
 *     verdict; probe salvage recovers it across aborts.
 *   - fleet-accounting-set-once (F1, EXECUTION side; exchange.ts owns the
 *     merge rule): the FIRST delegate call of a task fixes the task-level
 *     `description` (describeFleet over this call's brief) and
 *     `masterSessionPath` (this call's orchestratorSessionPath) via
 *     applyFleetTaskFields — later spawns never overwrite them. Collect is
 *     also the usage-cache WRITER (persistTaskUsageSnapshot); read paths
 *     never write.
 *   - advisory-by-contract (spawn side): manifest warnings, fleet journal,
 *     archive, fleet-idle nudges, progress pings and collect-time teardown
 *     never alter a collect verdict or a spawn outcome.
 * External runtime dependencies (ZCS, ported from the bundle's delegate-tool
 * contract): the injected Transport (herdr subprocess layer — never imported
 * directly); ~/.pi/agent/pi-delegate.config.json (tier table, defaults,
 * watch settle gate/releaseOn — via usage.ts/observe.ts resolvers);
 * <cwd>/.pi/delegate-schemas/ + ~/.pi/agent/pi-delegate-schemas/ (report-
 * schema library); the exchange dir on disk (manifest.json, briefs,
 * report-<name>.json, q-/a-<name>.json, p-<name>.jsonl, teardown.log); the
 * worker's pi session JSONL (gauges, budget, probe/aged-finish proof);
 * ctx.sessionManager.getSessionFile() (orchestrator session identity).
 * Error modes: never throws past the tool boundary — every failure is a
 * structured result with an E_* code from transport.ts's taxonomy
 * (E_NAME/E_BRIEF/E_TIER/E_PLACE/E_START/E_PROMPT_STALLED/E_TIMEOUT/
 * E_REPORT_MISSING/E_REPORT_INVALID/E_CONTEXT/E_BUDGET).
 * Shared file-local helpers defined identically by both source files
 * (ToolResult, errText, fail, textResult) are kept once — in section 1
 * (mailbox); the delegate section's byte-identical duplicates were dropped
 * (declared mechanical dedupe, see report-w4-spawn.json).

 * pi-delegate — `delegate` tool (DESIGN.md §5.1).

 * OWNERSHIP: worker B (impl-tools).
 *
 * Spawns one herdr worker, briefs it, and blocks until it settles, then
 * validates the report file. BLOCKING by design; Esc (abort signal) detaches —
 * the worker keeps running and is recoverable via `delegate_status`. Errors are
 * surfaced as structured tool results (DESIGN.md §7), never thrown raw.
 *
 * Manifest discipline: the ManifestWorker record is written immediately after
 * place() succeeds and BEFORE startAgent — a failed start still leaves a real
 * placement that /delegate-teardown must be able to clean up.
 *
 * Dependency rule: imports transport.ts and exchange.ts only — never the
 * transport IMPLEMENTATION directly (herdr CLI lives behind
 * createHerdrTransport, bound once in index.ts).
