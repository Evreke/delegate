/**
 * pi-delegate — tool-result: the shared tool-result vocabulary + the small
 * error/sleep helpers every tool module needs — extracted verbatim from
 * spawn.ts (Wave 3, step 4; the audit's "six duplicate helper clusters"
 * finding: this is the structural kill of the byte-identical errText/
 * asDelegateError copies that used to live in spawn.ts, observe.ts's
 * commands and the watcher loop).
 * <p>
 * MODULE_CONTRACT: pure value shapes + pure helpers, zero I/O — the
 * structured tool-result contract (ARCHITECTURE.md Law 8: errors are RETURNED as
 * failed results with an E_* code, never thrown raw across the tool
 * boundary) plus the error→message/code coercion helpers and the
 * abort-aware sleep. Dependencies: host.ts (DelegateErrorImpl +
 * the DelegateError/DelegateErrorCode types). A leaf module: nothing here
 * imports anything but the shared types.
 * Critical invariants (moved verbatim from spawn.ts):
 *   - fail() stamps `ok: false` + the E_* code into details — the intercept
 *     and the checks read the typed field, never message text;
 *   - typedCode() reads the code off a typed DelegateErrorImpl and falls
 *     back to the positional code only for plain errors (migration stage 1,
 *     audit errors-defect 1);
 *   - sleep() resolves EARLY when the abort signal fires (the
 *     abort-detaches-never-kills discipline — the wait is cancellable,
 *     never the worker).
