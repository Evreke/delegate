/**
 * pi-delegate — src/transport.ts (W3 refactor: merged module).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the herdr boundary: seam + implementation in ONE file.
 *
 * Purpose: the Transport seam (interface + req/result types), the E_* error
 * taxonomy, the report/mailbox envelope contracts and their guards, the
 * worker-name rule, briefPrompt, the budget/context gauge constants — plus
 * the single herdr CLI implementation (HerdrTransport) of that seam.
 *
 * Dependencies: node builtins only (child_process, fs, net, os, path, util).
 * Depends on NO other src/ module — bottom of the import graph.
 *
 * Exported surface (union of the two merged sources, verbatim):
 *   - seam: PlacementMode, AuthorityMode, PlacementReq, Placement,
 *     AgentStatusName, StartReq, StartResult, PromptReq, SettleResult,
 *     AgentStatus, TeardownReq, TransportCapabilities, Transport
 *   - errors: DelegateErrorCode (E_* taxonomy), DelegateError,
 *     DelegateErrorImpl
 *   - tier/budget governor: SpawnTier, SessionUsage, CONTEXT_WARN_PCT,
 *     CONTEXT_CRITICAL_PCT, CONTEXT_TURNS_WARN, CONTEXT_WINDOWS,
 *     DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOW, DEFAULT_BUDGET_TOKENS, BUDGET_CONFIG_PATH,
 *     BUDGET_WARN_FRACTION
 *   - report contract: ReportEvidence, WorkerReport, WORKER_NAME_RE,
 *     REPORT_EXAMPLE, briefPrompt
 *   - envelopes: QuestionEnvelope, AnswerEnvelope, isQuestionEnvelope,
 *     ProgressEvent, isProgressEvent
 *   - herdr impl: HerdrTransport, HerdrRunResult, HerdrPlacement,
 *     sessionHasReply, parseHerdrResult, createHerdrTransport
 *   - herdr socket client (W3 read-only path): DEFAULT_HERDR_SOCK,
 *     SOCKET_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS, SOCKET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS, HerdrSocketError,
 *     HerdrSocketClient, HERDR_SOCKET_TRANSPORT_ENV
 *
 * Critical invariants OWNED here (report-ref-map.json hiddenInvariants):
 *   - serialized-mutations: all herdr MUTATING ops (place/start/prompt/
 *     teardown) are serialized through one internal promise chain; read-only
 *     ops (getStatus/listStatuses/readPane) are NOT queued and may interleave.
 *   - settle-before-start-race-d3: waitSettle is a two-phase state machine —
 *     before the first working/blocked/done observation, idle/unknown slices
 *     never count as settle; timeout without any → neverStarted.
 *   - aged-finish-blind-spot: an unexplained idle is disproven out-of-band —
 *     proofSettled (report file mtime ≥ spawn) is THE completion criterion,
 *     settle status is advisory only; or sessionHasReply (assistant message
 *     in the session JSONL).
 *   - abort-detaches-never-kills: the abort signal cancels the WAIT, never
 *     the worker.
 *   - fresh-session-assumption: the session-reply proof assumes each worker
 *     gets a fresh pi session.
 *   - worktree-authority: root orchestrators may create/remove worktrees;
 *     sub-orchestrators (cwd under ~/.herdr/worktrees/) may only open tabs —
 *     enforced in capabilities()/placeInner/teardownInner, not by callers.
 *   - seam purity (plan-A types.ts contract): this module must NOT know pi
 *     ExtensionAPI; spawn.ts (tools) and index.ts (commands, absorbed in W5)
 *     import the seam types and NEVER the herdr implementation (dependency
 *     rule, pinned by static-check T1.1 / watcher-check W1.1).
 *
 * Error modes: the E_* taxonomy (DESIGN.md §7) — typed DelegateError
 * results, never raw throws past the tool boundary.
 *
 * External runtime dependencies (ZCS, ported from the bundle's herdr/types
 * module contracts): the `herdr` CLI binary on PATH — every mutating call
 * shells out via spawn with ARRAY args (never shell strings); read-only ops
 * (agent list/get) go over the herdr NDJSON unix socket (W3, zero
 * subprocesses) unless HERDR_SOCKET_TRANSPORT=cli; the HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID
 * env var (tab placement — herdr sets it in every pane session);
 * process.cwd() vs the fixed herdr worktree root ~/.herdr/worktrees
 * (homedir-resolved in code; root/sub authority — see
 * isSubOrchestratorCwd); the worker's session JSONL on disk (aged-finish
 * proof — see sessionHasReply). Parsing invariant: herdr prints a JSON line
 * {"id":...,"result":...} on stdout (verified 2026-09-05); the last
 * non-empty line is parsed and .result used; non-JSON output degrades to
 * null + raw text, never a throw.
 *
 * Sections (banner-delimited, bodies byte-verbatim from the pre-merge files;
 * herdr's type-only import of ./types.ts was dropped — the types are
 * in-module after the merge):
 *   1. src/transport/types.ts — seam + contracts (review-verified header
 *      docblock preserved verbatim).
 *   2. src/transport/herdr.ts — herdr CLI implementation (review-verified
 *      header docblock preserved verbatim).

/**
 * pi-delegate — transport seam and shared contracts.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: this file is authored by the tech lead and is the review artifact
 * for the whole extension. Implementation workers must NOT edit it; they code
 * against it. If a contract here is wrong, escalate to the orchestrator —
 * do not patch around it locally.
 *
 * Dependency rule: spawn.ts (tools) and index.ts (commands, absorbed in W5)
 * may import transport.ts and exchange.ts only. They must NEVER import the
 * herdr IMPLEMENTATION directly — createHerdrTransport is bound once in
 * index.ts (pinned by static-check T1.1/T1.1b).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT (ZCS, ported from the bundle's types.ts header): pure
 * types, constants and tiny pure helpers — no I/O of its own. Critical
 * invariants: DelegateErrorCode is the FIXED E_* list (the transport maps
 * every herdr failure into exactly one of them — never raw throws past the
 * tool boundary); WorkerReport is the schema BOTH the delegate tool
 * (validateReport) and the watcher validate reports against — changing it
 * breaks both sides at once; Transport implementations must serialize
 * mutating ops internally (DESIGN.md §9); REPORT_EXAMPLE is the canonical
 * report shape embedded into every worker prompt; CONTEXT_WINDOWS mirrors
 * pi's model catalog values and must be kept in sync with it manually.

/**
 * Run one `herdr <args>` CLI call with a hard time bound and SIGKILL escalation.
 * <p>
 * FUNCTION_CONTRACT:
 * Input:
 *   - args: herdr CLI argv (array — never shell strings)
 *   - timeoutMs: hard bound on the call (default CLI_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000)
 * Output: { stdout, stderr } of a zero-exit run
 * Guarantees:
 *   - the promise ALWAYS settles: at timeoutMs the child gets SIGTERM (execFile
 *     parity), its stdio is destroyed (parity with node's exec timeout), and
 *     after a further SIGKILL_GRACE_MS it gets SIGKILL — so a herdr build with
 *     a graceful-shutdown SIGTERM handler cannot hang this promise forever
 *     (BUG_FIX_CONTEXT below). The promise rejects AT timeoutMs, not when the
 *     escalated kill lands.
 *   - failure shape preserved from the promisified-execFile implementation:
 *     the thrown error carries .killed/.signal/.code/.stdout/.stderr and its
 *     message carries stderr text — callers match error text (isNotFound,
 *     agent_name_taken, agent_prompt_stalled regexes) against it unchanged
 *   - the child is reaped even when it dies AFTER the rejection (external or
 *     escalated SIGKILL): the parent's loop reaps it via the still-open libuv
 *     process handle — no zombie while the loop is healthy
 * Raises:
 *   - Error (wrapped by callers) for non-zero exit, spawn failure (ENOENT),
 *     maxBuffer overrun, or timeout
 * EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY: `herdr` CLI binary on PATH (resolved at spawn time).
 * <p>
 * BUG_FIX_CONTEXT (SIGKILL escalation, 2026-09-09 herdr incident follow-up):
 * symptom — the promisified execFile timeout sends SIGTERM only; a herdr build
 * with a graceful-shutdown SIGTERM handler survives it forever, the promise
 * NEVER settles (leak-probe sig.log; re-reproduced with a silent-trap stub:
 * pending past the 30s timeout mark), and via the serialized-mutations queue
 * in HerdrTransport every later mutating op (place/start/prompt/teardown)
 * stalls behind it while read-only ops and the event loop stay healthy
 * (h3-queue-stall repro). Why SIGTERM-only did not work: node's exec timeout
 * cannot recover a child that ignores SIGTERM, and D-state children would
 * ignore it too. What was done: kept the SIGTERM-at-timeout contract, then
 * escalated to SIGKILL after SIGKILL_GRACE_MS (armed at spawn, cleared on
 * close); the promise rejects at the timeout mark. Side-effect fix: the old
 * implementation RESOLVED ok-with-empty-stdout when the direct child had
 * already exited but a descendant kept the stdio pipes open (the timeout
 * "kill" hit a dead pid and node's close-on-timeout surfaced as success) —
 * the spawn-based escalation destroys stdio at timeout and rejects properly.
 * Exported for tests (transport-sigkill.ts drives it with stub CLIs).

 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT (productionized from the leak-probe prototype, live-validated
 * against herdr 0.8.2):
 * Dependencies: node:net, node:os, node:path only.
 * Protocol (per /tmp/herdr-socket-api.mdx + live validation): newline-delimited
 *   JSON over ~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock; request {"id","method","params"};
 *   response {"id","result"} or {"id","error":{code,message}}; pushed events
 *   arrive as lines carrying an "event" key with the payload under "data".
 * Critical invariants:
 *   - every request has a hard timeout (default SOCKET_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS) — a
 *     hung server rejects the request, it can never hang a caller forever
 *   - connection establishment is bounded by SOCKET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS
 *   - ZERO subprocesses: a frozen/dead server costs a bounded per-call error —
 *     never a spawned CLI child (the 2026-09-09 pile-up ammunition)
 *   - the server is ONE-REQUEST-PER-CONNECTION for plain requests (answers,
 *     then closes; only subscriptions keep a connection open — verified: a
 *     pipelined request #2 is never answered, the client sees ECONNRESET), so
 *     a plain-request close is the NORMAL lifecycle: the client transparently
 *     reconnects and retries exactly once; subscriptions live on their own
 *     connection state and a close there is a genuine failure (surfaced via
 *     onClose, never silently retried)
 * Error modes: HerdrSocketError with a stable `code` (connect_timeout,
 *   connect_error, request_timeout, connection_closed, or the server's own
 *   code, e.g. not_found) — mapped by callers into the E_* taxonomy.
