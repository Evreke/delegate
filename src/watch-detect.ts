/**
 * pi-delegate — watch-detect: the watcher's EVENT MODEL + SNAPSHOT + DETECTION
 * — extracted verbatim from observe.ts (Wave 3, audit
 * Law 5: modules are responsibilities). This module answers "what is the
 * fleet doing and what events fire"; the tick loop, delivery and §23 retire
 * live in watcher.ts / watch-retire.ts / status-tool.ts.
 * <p>
 * MODULE_CONTRACT: pure detection layer — event kinds/keys (the canonical
 * dedup key shape), the manifest+status snapshot merge (workersFromManifests),
 * the tolerant status read, and the detection priority ladder
 * (detectWorkerEvents) with its dedup/reset cache loop (detectEvents).
 * Dependencies: manifest-store.ts + watch-store.ts (manifest + satellite
 * stamp reads), watch-role.ts (the CANONICAL ownership verdict — the module
 * is a leaf with zero production imports), usage.ts (the ONLY session-JSONL
 * parser — one-parser law), mailbox-store.ts (q-file / nudge-marker reads),
 * report-schema.ts (report validation), watch-config.ts (detection
 * constants), host.ts (the Transport seam + shared types).
 * Critical invariants (owned here, moved verbatim from observe.ts):
 *   - collectedAt-dedup (reader side): report-ready/report-invalid are SILENT
 *     once the manifest records collectedAt — the watcher `seen` dedup is
 *     session memory only, so a fresh session would re-wake on old reports
 *     without the stamp. Detection only READS the stamp; collect writes it.
 *   - ownership fail-closed (watcher stage A): detection answers the ONE
 *     canonical verdict (src/watch-role.ts) — only a proven owner ("mine")
 *     produces events; a legacy no-owner manifest produces events only under
 *     an explicit watch.legacyFailOpen:true; a degraded self-id produces
 *     NOTHING unconditionally (no configuration escape); skipped detections
 *     are auditable (onSkip).
 *   - every read tolerant: garbage manifests/statuses degrade to fewer
 *     events, never a throw (advisory by contract).
 * Never imports the transport implementation (dependency rule, ARCHITECTURE.md
 * Law 4 — the Transport instance is injected from index.ts).
