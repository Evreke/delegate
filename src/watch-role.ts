/**
 * pi-delegate — canonical ownership verdict for the watcher (stage A).
 * <p>
 * MODULE_CONTRACT: the ONE source of truth for wake-ownership semantics
 * (WATCHER-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDELINE.md §3.4–§3.6). Three consumers fold the
 * same verdict into their own vocabulary: delivery (observe.ts
 * detectWorkerEvents — deliver only on a proven owner), the mount gate
 * (observe.ts isWorkerSession/ownsChildManifests via sessionRole) and the UI
 * display (fleet.ts classifyOwnership). This module is a LEAF: it imports
 * NOTHING from production code — manifest and session shapes are declared
 * structurally here — because observe.ts already imports fleet.ts, so
 * fleet.ts cannot import observe.ts (a module cycle breaks the extension
 * loader; field lesson, commit 83ccaab). No herdr-adapter imports
 * (dependency rule, guideline §7.2). No filesystem, no transport, no clock:
 * pure functions over plain data, tolerant of garbage fields by design (a
 * manifest is untyped JSON at the edge).
 * Critical invariants:
 *   - delivery is fail-closed: only the verdict "mine" delivers; the
 *     "no-owner" edge may be rolled back ONLY by the explicit
 *     watch.legacyFailOpen flag; the "no-self-id" edge has NO configuration
 *     escape (guideline §3.6) — the flag never reaches it;
 *   - worker-level orchestratorSessionPath is the canon owner field
 *     (guideline §3.2); masterSessionPath is fleet accounting and only a
 *     fallback (the B1 narrowing lives inside the "foreign" verdict);
 *   - this module never WRITES owner fields — ownership is recorded by the
 *     spawn path only (guideline §3.3).
 * Exported surface: AudienceVerdict, OwnerFields, SessionIdentity,
 * AudienceOptions, workerAudienceMatch, SessionRole, sessionRole.
 * Error modes: none — every read degrades (non-string/garbage owner fields
 * read as absent), never throws.

 *   anywhere on the manifest), "no-self-id" (this session's identity is

 *   - the "no-self-id" edge wins over everything: an unreadable identity can
 *     neither prove nor disprove ownership, and §3.6 gives it no
 *     configuration escape — the flag is deliberately NOT consulted when the
 *     self-id is missing (a legacyFailOpen:true session with a degraded id
 *     still delivers nothing);
 *   - worker-level owner wins over master-level (guideline §3.2: the canon
 *     is the worker entry's orchestratorSessionPath; masterSessionPath only
 *     narrows when the worker-level field is absent — the B1 fallback);
