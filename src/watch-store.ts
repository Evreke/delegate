/**
 * pi-delegate — src/watch-store.ts (Wave 3a: extracted from src/exchange.ts).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the watcher's satellite persistence.
 *
 * Purpose: the per-watcher satellite files in the task dir, both families:
 *   - the retire-stamp layers (watch-<watcherKey>.json — retirableSince /
 *     retiredAt; readers MERGE manifest layer + satellite layers, earliest
 *     stamp wins; writer: updateWatchStamps, owner-exclusive file);
 *   - the durable delivered-facts store (delivered-<watcherKey>.json,
 *     watcher stage B — committed after a successful wake-up send; records
 *     are only ADDED, removal is GC-only when a worker really disappears).
 * Both share the same watcherKey convention (FNV-1a of the session JSONL
 * path, "anon" for a degraded self-id) and the same single-writer
 * discipline (one writer session per file BY FILE NAME; in-process
 * serialization via withFileMutationQueue) — that shared identity is why
 * they live in ONE module.
 *
 * Dependencies: @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent (withFileMutationQueue),
 * node builtins, ./manifest-store.ts (the ONE atomic writer).
 *
 * Critical invariants OWNED here:
 *   - single-writer per satellite file by construction (file name carries
 *     the watcher key); writes atomic + idempotent (no-change → no write);
 *   - reads are tolerant: missing/corrupt/torn files read as empty — a torn
 *     read costs at most one repeated wake-up, never a throw;
 *   - the manifest FORMAT for external consumers is unchanged — the
 *     satellite files are the agreed exception (migration stage 3).
 *
 * All bodies are byte-verbatim moves from src/exchange.ts (Wave 3a).

// Observer stamps — the watcher's satellite file (migration stage 3, audit
// steps 6/10). The stamps the WATCHER writes (retirableSince — the persisted
// retire-TTL clock; retiredAt — the successful close marker) leave the
// manifest: the manifest stays the SPAWNING session's artifact (single writer
// per file — the lost-update hazard between a watcher stamp and a concurrent
// owner-side manifest write becomes impossible BY CONSTRUCTION). Each watcher
// session owns exactly one satellite file per task dir (watch-<watcherKey>.json,
// watcherKey = FNV-1a of the watcher's session JSONL path; "anon" for a
// degraded self-id — shared, but strictly no worse than the old shared
// manifest). Readers MERGE the layers: manifest fields first, then every
// satellite file in the dir; the earliest stamp per field wins (the earliest
// clock start / the first close is the truth). The manifest FORMAT for
// external consumers is unchanged — the satellite is the agreed exception.
